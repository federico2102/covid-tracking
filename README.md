# COVID Tracking Web App

## Overview

The COVID Tracking Web App is a tool designed to monitor COVID-19 cases and inform individuals of possible exposure to positive cases. Users can check in at various locations by scanning QR codes generated by the admin. In the event that a user tests positive for COVID-19, the app automatically notifies other users who may have been in contact within recent days.

## Features

### User Features
- **Location Check-In/Out**: Users can check in and check out of locations by scanning a QR code.
- **Contact Notification**: Users who were present at the same location during the same time range as a positive case will be notified through the app and via email.
- **Self-reporting COVID Status**: Users can report if they have tested positive and later confirm when they have fully recovered.
- **Risk Alerts**: Users with exposure risk will receive warnings before checking in to any location.

### Admin Features
- **Location Management**: Admins can add new locations with:
  - Unique name
  - Maximum capacity
  - Geolocation (latitude and longitude)
  - QR code generation for each location
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Admins can view a dashboard with statistics such as:
  - Total users
  - Total locations
  - Number of infected users

- **Location Status Monitoring**: Admins can check the capacity and current occupancy of each location on a map.
